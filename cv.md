## About me

*I'm a student of second course of specialty "Software information technology" in Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno. I like programming, but I think that some basic knowledge from the university is too little to become a successful programmer, so I signed up for this JavaScript course. I try to devote most of my time to learning programming and in the future I want to become a professional in my field.*
